My name is Antonio Peza. I graduated with my Bachelors Degree in Computer Science in June 2022. I have been working as a Systems Engineer for the past 8 years, mainly working with virtual servers, networking, and mobile device management. I also have experience migrating users to AWS and Azure.

I am looking to make the change to full time software engineering/development. I am open to learning new technologies, and assisting on any projects that need engineers.

Some projects I've worked on:

- Machine learning: Built a bot to identify dog breeds based on a picture
- Full-Stack Java: Built a CRUD program that allows users to manage their existing and upcoming appointments. Program also handles log in/out and generates reports
- Data Structures and Algorithms: Developed an application to optimize a delivery route based on a list of packages that include delivery location and deadline
